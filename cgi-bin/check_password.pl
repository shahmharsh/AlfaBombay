#   This script reads a username and password from the command line,
#   then compares it to entries in password.dat.  You will want to use
#   this technique in your script that validates user logins.
#   The salt value is not needed as it is extracted from the encrypted
#   block.  You do not need to encrypt the password entered by the user
#   as this will be done by the check_password function.
