An eCommerce Website to sell Mobile Phones

Designed and developed backend system for inventory management for a mobile phone selling website. The admin of the
website can add/edit/delete items. Implemented this part using PERL on the server side. There is a inventory in and out
management system implemented, where the admin can record the transactions on the items which come in and go out. A log
of each transaction is maintained. This system is implemented using java servlets on the server side and JSP's. 

Also implemented the customer side of the website to showcase and sell goods.

This was a semester long project.
